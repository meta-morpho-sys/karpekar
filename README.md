# The Kaprekar's constant
I was inspired to write this little kata after reading about Kaprekar's constant.
 
The Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar is remembered today for a range of curious mathematical patterns that he discovered. 

The best known is probably that related to the number `6174`, sometimes called Kaprekar’s constant.
starting from any 4-digit number (other than “repdigits” like 3333) and repeating the same process, we always arrive at 6174.
