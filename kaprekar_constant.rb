# The Karpekar's Constant

### Take a four digit number( must have at least 2 different digits)
# Sort it from biggest to smallest
# Subtract from the sorted (big) the mirror image of it (small)
# Take the result and repeat the process it converges to Kaprekarâ€™s constant '6174'
# Once this fixed point is reached, the process will simply cycle.
# Exit after the second cycle.
# Tasks after implementation:
# Count steps to completion
